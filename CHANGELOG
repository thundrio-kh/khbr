4.1.0
New Things
* Added the ability to customize your randomization experience, by providing 'override_enemies.yaml', and 'override_locations.yaml' files in the same directory as the randomizer exe. Documentation is [here](COMING SOON)
* The dataspace mission in Tron is now randomized
* Randomized the Audience Chamber Minnie escord mission (PC only). Some of the enemies that fire projectiles are limited to spawn less than the normal 27 entities that are in that room, either due to crashing or difficulty of the fight
* When bosses as enemies is turned on, bosses can no longer replace enemies in missions. Also upped the % for a boss to replace an enemy to 5% (from 1.2). Also bosses can only replace at most one enemy per spawnpoint to alleviate memory concerns.
* Changed wild enemies mode to be limited so that it attempts to match the variety of enemies in the original spawn (IE if a spawn has only shadows, it could be only Dancers. But if a spawn has shadows and soldiers, it could be Dancers and Dusks). This was done to try and alleviate memory issues
* On PC, adds a lua that should prevent Sora from T-Posing in some instances that were causing softlocks

AI Changes
* Fix issue where struggle bosses would not be invulnerable in fights with invulnerable bosses (IE Hades I or other Struggle bosses)
* Updated Hydra Head AI so when executing the finisher RC, you are rubberbanded back to where Sora started the RC, instead of a random location in the arena
* Fixes for Axel AI so that he properly does the assault attacks from the edge of the fire floor, instead of near the center
* Updated Hydra AI to prevent the player from executing the "Phil One-Two" RC more than once, in order to prevent a crash

Fixes
* Discovered an issue where in some locations and some bosses entering the room while in Limit form will result in a crash. This has been observed for Hydra and The Experiment, and it is unclear how extensive the issue is, and a fix is not obvious. This has been noted on the KNOWN_ISSUES page, and some bosses have been marked as risky in the struggle fights (which is the set of locations where you are most likely to enter while in limit form)
* Will no longer place the Bulky Vendors that automatically disappear
* Fixed issue where Pirates would still be damageable outside of moonlight if they only replaced other pirates
* Updated locations to ignore some boss spawns that don't get used (b_99) but end up causing problems in Wild mode
* Minor logic adjustments for softlock prevention purposes
* Changed name of "Include more locations" option to "Allow more risky replacements" to be more obvious about what the option does and that it can make crashes more likely
* Changed the category for Gargoyles to memoryLarge so that they can't replace shadows on PS2 (which can cause a crash)
* Updated Cutscene Remover functionality to only create one copy of each modified event in the mod zip

4.0.3

Fixes
* Made improvements to Revenge Limit Rando to only randomize the revenge limit of enemies/bosses that specifically have a Karma limit set in their AI.
* Issue of infinite loading on entering Hades I fight has been fixed.
* Undead Pirate (Rifle) should now be damageable when other enemies are randomized.
* Atlantica cutscenes are no longer removed when cutscene removal is turned on.
* The Jafar spawn locations have been fixed so that bosses walk on invisible ground instead of falling infinitely.
* Fixed issue with Timeless River variant of Minute Bombs not having explosion properly disabled
* When HP Scaling is turned off, Sephiroth and Prison Keepers base HP is set to 1878 in order to not crash when viewing with Scan on a high battle level

New things
* Forced variations are possible, so in some locations Pete will always be the cups version of Pete, due to the Timeless River version not working in that location.
* Misc bosses option has been removed, and MCP/Shadow Stalker/Oogie boogie have been removed from the pool completely, and there are no plans to ever randomize these "gimmick/minigame" bosses.
* Storm Rider has been temporarily removed from the pool, until the proper AI edits can be made.
* More locations option has been added, to allow placing bosses in locations that are deemed tedious/unfair for whatever reason, or that have softlocks which can be avoided with skillful play (IE Sephiroth as a Lord replacement falls in this category).
* The OC Demyx fight has been added as a source location when "Wild" mode is on.
* A massive amount of logic changes have been made, as each location has been hand chosen to be allowed or disallowed. Previously on PC 2189/3025 replacements were allowed by the logic. Now 2364/3025 are allowed.
* UP to date Boss Compatability CSV files are now present in the KHBR repository, to show where bosses are allowed to spawn. There is also a _ideal.odt open office spreadsheet that is color coded which may be easier to see (this is the file I hand edit when deciding what should be allowed). A empty/green cell is an allowed replacement. A X/red cell is not allowed. A F/purple cell is allowed but it is forced to one specific version of that boss (IE Pete Cups instead of Pete TR). A G/Blue cell is a replacement that is only allowed when the "More Locations" option is chosen.
* A KNOWN_ISSUES page has been added to the khbr repository listing known issues for bosses. Currently there are no major issues that cannot be worked around on this list.

AI Changes

* Barbossa AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. The Illuminator will spawn in a random location somewhere in the arena (not necessarily on a wall).
* Axel AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. When he does his jump into the fire, he will spawn in the middle of the fire circle and lunge in a random direction.
* Roxas AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. It becomes relatively easy to avoid his DM in large arenas.
* Final Xemnas Data AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. Previously the initial attack spawning blue orbs could lock Xemnas OOB
* Xigbar AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. 
* Dark Thorn has had the chandelier removed due to potential for crashes, and he starts the fight visible instead of invisible.
* Thresholder AI has had some modifications but doesn't always work right yet (should still be beatable everywhere)
* Grim Reaper II AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. When he sucks in the coins from the chest he can be positioned father away from the chest than normal, but the RC should still work normally
* Luxord AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. Sometimes when Luxord transforms into a bunch of cards it can spawn OOB, but they should come to you eventually or transform back
* Marluxia AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. The pools he spawns are now placed randomly in the available space in the arena (sometimes they can be on top of each other)
* Hydra AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. The 3 Hydra heads that spawn are no placed randomly within the available space in the arena, they can be on top/near each other or spawn on top of the main hydra body
* Hostile Program AI has been fixed so that it should properly circle around the halfway point between Sora and Hostile Program's initial spawn locations.
* Pete TR AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates.
* Zexion AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. The 3 Miracle Circle's he can spawn may spawn anywhere on the map, and may be on top of each other
* The Experiment AI has been fixed to no longer rely on hardcoded coordinates. When it splits into the 3 parts of it's body, those parts tend to all spawn on top of each other.
* Pete OC II AI has been fixed so that it no longer crashes on the attack where he summons a boulder to fall on top of Sora.

3.1.0
* Cutscene remover option has been revamped, and now only has a true/false option because all of the major problems have been fixed. Only real issues at the moment are a small handful of cutscenes do not get removed
* Removed MCP from being able to be randomized, for the moment
* Limited the number of locations Jafar can show up in
* Hades I is no longer randomized, due to a bug where the fight can get stuck in infinite loading
* Fixed issue with Pirates not being damageable when misc enemies is on

3.0.3
* Hotfix for Party Member Rando. Also prevent Final Battle Riku object from being used in party member rando (When Riku shows up it will always be world TNTNW Riku)

3.0.2
* Bullet proofed the AI mod logic to fix common 3.0 crashes such as STT struggle fights
* Added other_enemies as an option, which enabled bulky vendors, bees, and pirates all to be randomized in the "heartless" pool
* Fix for nightmare_enemies, now it should work as intended
* various changes to the placement logic to prevent crashes/softlocks/etc

3.0.0

New Features
* Misc bosses option has been added, and contains bosses such as Jafar, MCP, and other bosses that are more like gimmicks than not. In other news, Groundshaker is the only boss that can not be randomized at all. This should currently be treated as an unstable and experimental option
* Randomize superbosses option has been split into 3 options, for terra, sephiroth, and the datas
* There is now a Scale Boss Stats option. Turning it off will have close to the same effect as the Better Boss Scaling mod (however datas/terra will be forced to level 99 still)
* Added an option to treat Nobodys as a separate type of enemy, depending on the other options enabled this can cause some enemies to randomize very predictably
* Party member rando has been added. Currently Donald/Goofy are not randomized because the game throws a hissy fit when you have more than one world character in your party at once
* Costume rando has been added. Pretty simple but it was trivial to add at the same time as Party Member rando
* Revenge Limit Randomizer has been added as an option. This performs an AI edit on every enemy/boss in the game, even if enemy/boss randomizer is off. Note that all enemies have a base revenge limit cap of 100, which is what gets randomized. Some enemies however don't have any code to do anything when the revenge limit is hit, so in those cases no change will be seen. This is an exciting but beta feature, please give feedback on how it works and how it could be improved.
* Remove Most Cutscenes option has been added, with 3 different options. Minimal removes all cutscenes that it can without causing any issues. Non-Reward will additionally remove all cutscenes that appear before Missions, however there is a known issue where if you Game Over during a mission, hitting continue will put you right back into that fight (so you are effectively softlocked unless you can beat the fight). Maximum will additionally remove all cutscenes that appear before full screen popup rewards, the downside is that the popups no longer occur (but you do still get the reward, and in my experience the tracker still shows if you got something important). This should be considered beta, and please report any issues you find

Major Improvements
* Added an AllocEnemy line to event scripts on PC, which should help prevent crashes due to going out of memory on PC (IE limit form against Lexaeus was a common one that should now be fixed). There is a small possibility this will cause crashes in situations that would not crash on the old version, let me know if you think this is the case!
* An AI mod for Lexaeus, Larxene, and Zexion has been done to prevent teleport attacks sending Sora OOB. These bosses were the easiest to fix due to the removal of a "reset_pos" function that set positions to 0,0,0. Fixes are planned for other bosses with teleport related issues, but will take more time due to the exact teleport coordinates being hardcoded.
* Added Final Xemnas (and data) into the randomization pool. He will never perform dome or the attack to take sora's heart
* Fix crash that was preventing FF bosses from being randomized on PC (the mission complete camera will look different from normal)
* Struggle bosses have all been reenabled on PC
* Riku is now enabled in one to one
* Hydra fight has been reenabled on PC and no longer softlocks
* An AI edit has been made to prevent the disappearing HP bar and Armor Xemnas 2 has been restored rather than being a copy of Armor Xemnas 1
* Jafar has been added into the randomization pool as a misc boss. The Roll UP RC is disabled when Jafar is randomized, due to causing crashes when the carpet is not around
* Shadow Stalker has been added into the randomization pool as a misc boss.
* Oogie Boogie has been added into the randomization pool as a misc boss with a completely custom AI. Currently it uses Shadow Roxas AI and is very trivial to beat, expect changes to come.
* The timeless river version of Pete (with the scene changes) has been added into the randomization pool (Pete as a whole is now in the "misc" category)
* MCP has been added into the randomization pool as a misc boss, and Tron will appear as an extra party member wherever he shows up in order to accomadate the RC
* Minute bombs have been added back into the randomization pool after a hopeful fix to prevent softlocks in fights such as the first HT fight. If you still see softlocks related to Minute bombs dying, please let me know
* Axel Data no longer requires performing his RC in order to be killed
* The Illuminator will no longer move from the spot where Barbossa spawns it, to prevent issues where it moves to a unreachable location
* Now generating a custom moveset (thanks to DA) for Sora that will allow Twilight Thorn to work without major AI modifications
* Fully disable Xemnas I's DM, so Sora's HP is no longer locked into always draining during the fight
* Struggle fights will now prevent the placed boss from dying, so the struggle fight is actually a full struggle
* Enabled randomizing the two single dusk fights in STT where the enemy is invulnerable
* HT Presents fight is reenabled
* Invincible hades fights have now been added back into the randomization pool (whoever is set to randomize Hades will be the boss in each location, and they should have an HP floor to not die)
* Moved Spawn locations in Armor Xemnas 1 fight to prevent bosses getting softlocked by landing strangely on the throne

Minor Fixes
* Fixed Issue where Grim Reaper II in it's vanilla location in Wild mode could result in a softlock
* When HP is scaled, bosses HP is capped at Terras Base HP, to not cause crashes on using scan against higher HP values
* Aerial Vikings have been tagged as large enemies because they can cause crashes when replacing shadows
* Nightmare mode has had a couple adjustments, namely the addition of the Gambler that summons darkness on spawn
* Fix for logic issue that would sometimes cause the data version of a boss to be completely unrelated to the story version of the boss
* Updated allowed replacements for reducing known softlocks/crashes (common ones involving Grim Reaper 2 and Demyx)
* Prevent bosses from spawning in Encampment, when bosses as enemies mode is enabled
* Refactoring of some internals to allow for additional features
* After gaining a better understanding of the spawn system, nobady_call attack has been reenabled for Armor Xemnas 1, which used to cause crashing on PC
* When bosses as enemies is enabled, do not allow more than one boss per spawnpoint, which will hopefully help with stability
* Data Demyx has had an AI edit so that the timer for the form minigames is 40 seconds instead of 30 seconds. This should allow Data Demyx to be reasonably beaten by solo Sora
* Ai mod for Scar to prevent the T-Posing that can occur when Sora is 'caught'
* Various bosses that can cause softlocks as Mickey now don't allow summoning Mickey
* When collecting medals in Pirates 2, the coins should now properly disappear if not collected before the timer runs out
* Remove Scar Ghost from being able to appear as a boss enemy
* Fixed cases where some bosses were not getting properly changed when a specific boss was selected
* Prevent any attempt at randomizing Battle of 1K, to prevent crashes
* Move Spawn location for Groundshaker in front of Sora and to ground level
* Prevent bosses from spawning in The Ravine or Checkpoint rooms, when bosses as enemies mode is enabled.
* Due to a crash during DM, if Luxord Data is supposed to replace Luxord, the fight will stay vanilla Luxord
* Fixed issue where Hydra's MSN was not being properly replaced, causing bosses like Luxord or Demyx to softlock
* Prevent the option for Mickey appearing in STT boss fights, due to Roxas missing animations for summoning mickey causing T-Poses

Known Issues
* Jumping against Jafar while you are in a form can cause T-Poses due to being able to infinitely jump
* Bosses replacing Jafar are spawning lower than would be ideal
* In Party Member rando if Tron is replaced to himself, then the MCP fight will probably have two copies of Tron
* In Party Member rando, using Simba's limit when you are human Sora will cause a tpose/softlock
* In Party Member rando, using other party member limits as lion sora can tpose/softlock
* The Twilight Thorn RC is as fast as it is in the vanilla game, instead of being sped up like the GOA mod intends
* MCP Health is not halved, as GOA intends
* I have heard reports of softlocks in the Ambush fight, even though no enemies are randomized there. I cannot reproduce, so if this happens please submit a bug report with the seedstring
* The Olympus Stone may not work to unlock Drives as the GOA mod intends
* There has been a report that Riku causes crashes in Party Member rando, but I have not reproduced, so currently just gathering data on how often this occurs
* 


2.1
* Redesigned "Wild" enemies to now only put up to 5 different kinds of enemies in any one room (between all spawns in that room), which should make it mostly playable. This number will be reduced if necessary, and Wild is still only possible for PC. Due to the way the randomization is currently implemented, some enemies will be very likely to be vanilla (for example, the Bolt Towers in the first part of the Minnie Escort fight)
* Increased the number of bosses available when Bosses are allowed to replace normal enemies, and increased the odds of a boss replacement occuring to about 1 in 80 enemies
* If Data Demyx is to be placed in either Groundshaker or Scar's location, he will be forced to normal Demyx.
* Disable the "nobady_call" attack for Armor Xemnas 1, which should prevent crashing on PC

2.0
* Full redesign of the backend, to make future updates easier
* PC is now be able to load cups when enemies are randomized
* Options to not randomize big and small enemies separately. Warning should only be used on PC and it is experimental and may cause crashes
* Options to not randomize melee and ranged enemies separately. Warning should only be used on PC and it is experimental and may cause crashes
* Option to randomize enemies independently of each other. Warning should only be used on PC and it is experimental and will probably cause crashes
* Beast is added into the randomization pool, when he appears cogsworth will also appear.
* More bosses can now replace the final 3 bosses of the game (previously bosses like luxord could not appear due to his msn requirement)
* LOD Summit now has some enemies randomized, but in the timed fight it is possible some of the enemies won't spawn
* Can now choose where mickey can appear (follow the bosses he normally appears for, stay where he normally is, all bosses, no bosses)
* Added option to make OC cups give you XP and form XP
* Added quality of life option to make it possible to retry data final xemnas without going through data xemnas I again
* Removed the "Selected Boss" and "Selected Enemy" options from the enemy/boss dropdowns, and now if a selected boss/enemy is chosen, it assumes that is what you want
* Removed the ability to choose whether or not to scale bosses because the effect can be confusing/not what is expected. Bosses are now always scaled when possible.
* Misc. small fixes and improvements in a number of spots
* Minute Bombs and Assassins have been removed possible random enemies due to an issue with softlocks resulting from explosions in forced fights. If the randomizer would replace an enemy with Minute Bombs or Assassins, there will be Cannon Guns instead.
